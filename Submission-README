LegalAid AI is a web application that provides users with accurate and accessible legal information through a conversational AI interface. Users can ask legal questions related to topics such as contracts, employment rights, tenant laws, and more. The AI responds with relevant, easy-to-understand guidance, helping individuals better understand their legal options before seeking formal legal advice.

This project leverages the power of AI to bridge the gap between complex legal jargon and the general public, offering a first step in legal literacy and empowerment.
